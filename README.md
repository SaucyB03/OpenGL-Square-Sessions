# Square Sessions (2nd OpenGL Creation):
A simple game where you are being chased by red cubes. To protect yourself you are able to fire back at the incoming cubes. Includes simple jumping physics and movement around the screen. Using vertex and fragment shaders in OpenGL we were able to make each object have a unique color scheme. Then when the user dies it collects the information about the round and saves it to an external text file. Then our idea was to pass that to a server where you could see all the scores from those who have played the game. As well as displaying a Python graph containing your stats.

## Controls:
- A/D: move left/right
- S: drop platforms
- Space: jump
