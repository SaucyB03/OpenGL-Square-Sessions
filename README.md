## Square Sessions:
- A simple game where you are being chased by red cubes. To protect yourself you are able to fire back at the incoming cubes. Includes simple jumping physics and movement around the screen. Using vertex and fragment shaders in OpenGl we were able to make each object have a unique color scheme. Then when the user dies it collects the information about the round and saves it to an external text file. Then our idea was to pass that to a server where you could see all the scores from those who have played the game. As well as displaying a python graph containing your stats.
- installations: OpenGL, glm, GLFW
- I believe we earned a solid 80 because even though our implementation wasn't perfect, it was a good idea for the program and was fairly complex. I think because we understood our issues and why they were wrong, we just needed more time to perfect it.

## Bugs
- HTML and CSS don't fully work (the website is up and running) but the link (click me) is not working : [kjablon4.w3.uvm.edu/](https://kjablon4.w3.uvm.edu/mod3OE/stats.html)
- Python file doesn't present the graph of stats like supposed to (empty graph is shown instead).

## If we had more time
- We tried to connect the html to get the statistics from the spinnysquare.txt but it proved to be more challenging and even not possible according to stack overflow.
- After the html didn't work, we tried just using python to graph the stats but we ran out of time to display the stats correctly.
